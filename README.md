# ARCHIVED

nimi Linku (the Google sheet) and jasima Linku (this repo) have been archived, replaced by [sona Linku](https://github.com/lipu-linku/sona) (the dataset) and [nimi Linku](https://nimi.linku.la) (the localization platform Crowdin). If you are looking to contribute, please see those projects or join [kulupu Linku](https://discord.gg/A3ZPqnHHsy) (the Discord server).

# data.json schema

- This README documents both [nimi Linku, the sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xwgTAxwgn4ZAc4DBnHte0cqta1aaxe112Wh1rv9w5Yk/) and [jasima Linku, the database](https://linku.la/jasima/data.json), as jasima Linku is built from nimi Linku.
- Most fields are copied from [nimi Linku](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xwgTAxwgn4ZAc4DBnHte0cqta1aaxe112Wh1rv9w5Yk/) without change other than cleaned whitespace.

## Structure

- All fields are stored as strings, even if an integer or float representation would be appropriate.
- All immediate children of the top four keys (documented below) are stored alphabetically.
- If a key exists but has no value in nimi Linku, it will not be in jasima Linku. <!-- unless it is a parent to another field (see below) -->
- If a field's name contains a slash `/`, the word(s) before the slash is a parent key, and the word(s) after the slash is a child key. For example, the `Words` sheet or `data` parent key has `def/[language_code]` for all word definitions.
- It is not possible for a parent key to have the same name as a normal key; the updater script would fail, as it would attempt to insert to a string as though it were a dictionary.

## Reading the documentation

- A key is indicated with its name `key_name:`
- A variable key is indicated in brackets `[key_name]:`.
- If a bracketed key name has any formatting information, it will be documented in the first child key.
- Machine-reading instructions, if applicable, are indicated at the end of the description with \*\*surrounding asterisks\*\*.
